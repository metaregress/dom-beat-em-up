## I want to know what I've changed so far
Use `git status` to see a list of changed files, and `git diff` to see the exact changes to each file.

## I'm working on a new thing and don't want to mess up the main branch
`git checkout -b <your branch name>` will make a new branch based off whatever branch you checked out from. From there you can change things all you want and the main branch will never know until you merge.

## I want to be on a different branch
`git checkout <name of branch>` will get you there, though you may have to commit in-progress changes before git will let you swap. If you need a list of branches, just type `git branch`

## I have local changes and want git to remember them
This happens in a few steps. 

First, you have to 'add' your changes to a pending changelist, using `git add <files to add, separated by spaces>`

Once your changelist is assembled, you have to commit them, using `git commit` - make sure you write a descriptive message about what you're changing so you can remember later.


## I want to sync my work with what's on github
To take what github has and merge it with any local changes you have, use `git pull`

To send your commits up to github, use `git push`. You can't push if the repository has commits that you don't have, so you have to `git pull` first if someone is working in your branch with you.
